= Lab on Ajax

*  If you replace the SYMBOL with INFY or FB you will get a JSON output. Study the JSON output by copying it to http://jsonlint.com.

* Look for
_query.results.quote.LastTradePriceOnly_ (this will give the stock price) and
_query.results.quote.Change_  (this will give the change w.r.t the previous value)
